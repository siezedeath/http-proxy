# HTTP Proxy Design Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an in-depth description of the HTTP proxy's architecture, design decisions, and implementation details. The proxy is designed for high performance using asynchronous I/O, modern C++23 features, and modular components.

## Architecture

The project is divided into several key modules:

- **Proxy Server Module:**  
  Responsible for accepting client connections, reading HTTP requests, and forwarding them to remote servers.

- **HTTP Handling Module:**  
  Uses Boost.Beast to parse and format HTTP messages.

- **DNS Prefetching and Caching Module:**  
  Handles asynchronous DNS resolution using Boost.Asio and caches results for faster lookups.

- **HTTP Response Caching Module:**  
  Implements caching for HTTP responses, considering headers such as Cache-Control and ETag.

- **Content Filtering Module:**  
  Uses Gumbo Parser to analyze and filter HTML content based on predefined rules.

- **Logging Module (Optional):**  
  Incorporates spdlog for logging debug and runtime information.

## Detailed Design

### Proxy Server
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Manage client connections.
  - Delegate request processing to the HTTP handling module.
  - Forward responses back to clients.
- **Key Classes:**  
  - `ProxyServer`: Main class handling the server loop.
  - `HTTPRequestHandler` and `HTTPResponseHandler`: Interfaces for processing HTTP messages.

### DNS Prefetching and Caching
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Resolve domain names asynchronously.
  - Cache DNS results with TTL management.
- **Key Classes:**  
  - `DNSCache`: Maintains an in-memory cache using `std::unordered_map` and ensures thread safety with mutexes.

### HTTP Response Caching
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Cache HTTP responses to improve repeated request performance.
  - Implement cache invalidation based on HTTP headers.
- **Key Approaches:**  
  - Use an LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm.
  - Store cache entries in memory (or optionally on disk).

### Content Filtering
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Parse HTML content using Gumbo Parser.
  - Identify and remove/modify elements based on filtering rules.
- **Key Considerations:**  
  - Robust parsing of potentially malformed HTML.
  - Performance impact on large documents.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Caching Mechanisms:**  
  Explore on-disk caching or integration with external caching systems.
- **Security Improvements:**  
  Implement stricter validation and security controls to prevent abuse.
- **Performance Optimizations:**  
  Profile and optimize the asynchronous handling and caching mechanisms.

## Conclusion

This design document outlines the high-level and detailed aspects of the HTTP proxy. The modular architecture facilitates future enhancements and ensures maintainability.
